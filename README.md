# VisualMixer
A Chrome extension that allows you to make any webpage more pleasant to look at and readable.

You can modify Brightness, Contrast, Saturation and HUE-Rotation as well as the total inversion of the colors.
This allows you to quickly create a darkmode for any webpage if its not provided.

It even stores each configuration for each webpage individually :o
